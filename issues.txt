Outstanding Issues
-Calculating Botches and Failures is incorrect
  -Failures contribute negative successes instead of zero
  -Botches are calculated from suc < difficulty && rolled a 1, should be suc < 1 && rolled a 1
-give background rects and histogram rects different classes to solve rendering bug
-add difficulty selection to the HAML interface
